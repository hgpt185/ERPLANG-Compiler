Changes in grammar -
The language document specifies that the driver function is declared as -
  <<driver program>>
It should instead be -
  <<<driver program>>>

Modifications from the original specification document -
1. Floating point operations are not handled beyond the semantic analysis part.
2. Recursion is allowed.
3. If a function does not assign a particular output variable, it is shown as a warning and not a semantic error.
4. If a while loop body does not change any identifiers participating in its guard condition, it is shown as a warning and not a semantic error.
5. Redundant module declaration is not treated as a semantic error.
